# Implementation 

- Clean code 
	- close resources(socket,connection,ect) 
	- Override ToString
	- use static factory ||factory pattern if needed 
	- prohibit inheritance when not used 
		- Make constructor private 
		- Use final keyword 
	- implement autocloseable 
	- add @Override
	- Add Comments 
	- Make field final by default 
	- Exception 
		- clean 
		- use try with when using resources 
	- add synchronization statement 

-Pattern 
	- Static factory method 
	- Abstract factory 
	- Observer 

- UI
	- Polish 
		- Rescale components when downsizing window 
		- Use Icon for buttons (use labels & source folder)
	- First use Window 
		- Open dialog window to request username on first use 
	- File message 
		- Add button to embed file in message 
	- Message 
		- add timestamp 
	- Profil window 
	- Change Uname window 
	

- LocalCommunication 
	- DECONNECTION ! 
	- Try to make the system more scalable 
	- Use interface & think of SOLID 
	- make factory for message 
	- observer between localsystem and listener 
	- observer between localsystem and sessions ? 

- Session 
	- Make factory for session ( calling specific method depending on type of session ... )


# Perf 
	- Multithread dao 
	- Constraints 
		- Deployment <= 2h

# Deploy


# Polish 
	- Produce javadoc with comments (see resources)
	- Review effective Java items 
		- item 10 to 14 
	- Add documentation 
		- readMe
	- Redo UML
