# Research 
- Swing 
	- Search java swing best practices & design ( mvp ? other )
	- FireManagement 
- Servlet 
	- How to use 
	- REST 

# Implementation 

- Clean code 
	- close resources(socket,connection,ect) 
	- Override ToString
	- use static factory ||factory pattern if needed 
	- prohibit inheritance when not used 
		- Make constructor private 
		- Use final keyword 
	- implement autocloseable 
	- add @Override
	- Add Comments 
	- Make field final by default 
	- Exception 
		- clean 
		- use try with when using resources 
	- Serialization 
		- Use Json format 
	- add synchronization statement 
	- Make Serialization utility class 
		- extract user from packet function 

-Pattern 
	- Static factory method 
	- Abstract factory 
	- Observer 

- UI
	- Rescale components when downsizing window 
	- Use Icon for buttons (use labels & source folder)
	- Open dialog window to request username on first use 
	- Add button to embed file in message 
	- MVC 
		- Make Model interface allowing view to update using observer pattern 
			- Use listModel or similar component ? 
	

- LocalCommunication 
	- Try to make the system more scalable 
	- Use interface & think of SOLID 
	- make factory for message 
	- observer between localsystem and listener 
	- observer between localsystem and sessions ? 

- Session 
	- two state 
		- open 
		- close 
			- othert user has close session or is not online 
	- Make factory for session ( calling specific method depending on type of session ... )


# Perf 
	- Multithread dao 
	- Constraints 
		- Deployment <= 2h
		- username change visible to everyone <= 20s 
		- time between sending & receiving messages <= 1s
		- Central system able to withstand 1000 sessions 
		- LocalSystem able to withstand 50 sessions 
		- Inform of username unavailability <= 3s
		- Show Online user on connection <= 5s 
		- CentralSys withstand 100 000 users 
		- CentralSys memory footprint <= 100Mo 
		- CPU use <= 1% in 5s range measure 


# Deploy


# Polish 
	- Produce javadoc with comments (see resources)
	- Review effective Java items 
		- item 10 to 14 
	- Add documentation 
		- readMe
	- Redo UML
